        <h6>Posted on Aug. 29, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>I came home from school. It was my fifth birthday. I don't remember what we studied in school that day or what I wanted for my birthday, but I do remember what happened once I came home. I sat on the kitchen floor with my eyes shut. I felt something moving in my lap that felt furry and when it was time to open my eyes, I met my unforgettable friend, Jake.</p>

        <p>He was an underdog. My mum told me she adopted him from the humane society. He was the runt of the litter. He also had one ear that was lower and one that was much higher. He always looked like he was tilting his head to the side. <br> <br>He grew very big. I remember how heavy his head felt in my lap. I didn't like that he was confined to the dining room. I spent a lot of time studying in there with him by my side. Sometimes I felt bad that he didn't get to eat the yummy foods I got to eat and I remember giving him some pancakes once and he threw up later and I felt terrible that he got sick. <br> <br>We would rollerblade outside during the day. Once time, an electrician left the back gate open and Jake had escaped. I had to go to softball practice and I was so worried, I would never see him again. I had never felt so down. Luckily, he was found during practice running through the sprinkler in someone else's backyard. <br> <br>Sometimes, I wondered if that was the best day of his life. Perhaps, he felt free and ungoverned. Some nights, I would leave the gate to the dining room open on purpose and I would whisper his name to come lie by my bed at night and pet him from my bed until we fell asleep. Other times, I would sleep on the floor in front of the fridge, next to him, so he wasn't so lonely. <br> <br>
        I don't remember feeling like he understood very much. We also never taught him many tricks and the most he did was run around in our big backyard and play out there with me. In my eyes, he was perfect. The best.</p>

        <p>When Jake was about 6 years old, he started to seem slower than usual. He walked slowly, he looked sad, and didn't wag his rope-like tail like he always did. My mum took him to the vet, and they gave us devestating news.He had liver disease. <br> <br>He had yellow eyes, due to the excess bilirubin in his blood, since his liver was no longer doing a great job of filtering it out. He was always there to cheer me up, when I was sad.I felt so helpless, because I couldn't return the favor.</p>

        <p>My mum said that we should share some final days with Jake. She said he needed to be put to sleep, so we could relieve him from his pain. On his last day, I did a lot of thinking as I spent my last few moments with him. I got to take him to the park and take pictures with him with a disposable camera my mum purchased. <br> <br> I remember thinking, we never take him to the park. Why did we never take him? Why did was he never allowed out of the kitchen/dining room? He was so close to my heart and on his final day, I had so many regrets. I wished I could have given him more.</p>
